    This list has been compiled from data from over <%= number_to_human Package.fast_total %> packages as well as 30 Million open source repositories and 6 Billion dependencies linking them together.
    Rankings are based on packages with the highest downloads, dependent packages and repositories, stars and forks within each supported registry.
    New data is being collected and aggregated all the time, so these lists will continue to change and update.
